MSc Project - Geospatial Database Meeting
Skype Meeting Between Neil and Jason
Vitaliy was away at a conference
After much effort, a connection could not be formed with Sandra in
Mexico
28/06/2017

Key Points:

-> Need another meeting next week to go over Sandy's design and work
   out an integration plan

-> Proposed CouchDB/geocouch system was covered. The experimental work
   of Volker Mische, engineer at Couchbase for spatial polygon queries
   but in general it may be difficult and unweildy to put on the
   university servers to be accessed by SiloamRoute. Added to this,
   being experimental, support is not readily available which could
   slow down progress of the project. It may be better to simply
   install Couchbase, for which many binaries are available for a
   variety of systems. Whilst only allowing spatial bounding box
   queries, it may be adequate for a proof of concept.

-> The project should focus on a subset of categories, again to speed
   up development of the final product which should be thought of as a
   proof of concept. Kerb heights data needs to be included somewhere
   though.

-> Would be very useful if we could prove that door-to-door navigation
   is feasible by including doorways in the macro level features that
   are classfied.


Tasks Carried Over From Previous Meeting:

-> An estimate 50GB will be needed for the various RGB and depth images
   to train the propsed SVM in Jason's design specification. A very
   rough estimate of 70GB will be needed to store all of the 3D models
   used in conjuction with RGB-D data to train the same SVM. The
   couchDB/geocouch implementation shouldn't take up more than 100MB
   of webspace.

-> Jason specification and proposed design handed along with presentation
   slides that will be added to over the week before presentations on
   06/07/2017.

-> Presentations are to take place on 06/07/2017 between 10:00 and 12:00
   Neil might be able to make this.


Next Tasks:

-> Begin development!
