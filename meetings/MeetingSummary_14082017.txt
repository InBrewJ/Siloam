MSc Project - Geospatial Database Meeting
Vitaliy, Neil and Jason
Ashton Building Room 221, University of Liverpool
14/08/2017

Key Points:

-> The final database will be populated on a version hosted locally on Jason's
   machine. There will be functionality within the SiloamLearn C++ executable to
   export the JSON encoded feature database to a file. This can easily be sent to
   Sandra via email and she can populate a separate local couchbase server node
   on her own machine. Dave Shield never got back to me about any University web
   storage so this will have to do. SiloamLearn will also have various command line
   arguments, one of which will be the IP/URL and port number of a final couchbase
   server node.

-> Since Ed Pyzer-Knapp and colleagues are rather busy, Neil's PhD supervisor
   Dr Thiyagalingam Jeyarajan has kindly offered to lend a hand in any issues regarding
   the SVM. An email introduction has been made and he's also kindly willing to
   give some help face to face.


Next Tasks:

-> Final push to get the SVM trained and tested. Things are coming together!

Next Meeting:

-> Wednesday 23rd August, STFC (time TBC)
