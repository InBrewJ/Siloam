All present + Roger Downing
Costa, STFC Daresbury

-> USE SLACK! Neil has the first slack post...

-> Use Slack for the agile sprint things...

-> Shipping will be around Â£180 for the loan P2P - Neil has spoken to Robin and is
   willing to pay half - will liverpool pay the other half? Vitaliy will get back
   to Neil after some deliberation. An STFC courier must be used, hence the horrendous
   cost

-> How to correct for GPS innacuracy - corroborate the poor GPS accuracy with LIDAR data
   of say the corner of buildings. The drift from the lidar is random - but it could
   be used to improve the accuracy of inherently bad GPS data.

-> Went over the progress of the past 4 weeks for Roger's benefit (to see what has been
   accomplished since the project proposal was written)

-> Crossing points (on roads) would be key for the future

-> Maybe investigate scikit learn with python - but it probably uses LIBSVM under the hood

-> Do get somewhere with the SVM

Next tasks:

-> Extract all waypoints from OSM (Sandy)

-> See next three tasks on Asana (RGB-D Classification)

Next meeting:

-> Vitaliy will be in his office on Tuesday from 11:00 and maybe on Thursday/Friday

-> Generally the meeting will be in Liverpool next week - Neil will send a meeting
   invitation
