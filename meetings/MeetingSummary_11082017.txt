MSc Project - Geospatial Database Meeting
Neil and Jason - EEE Foyer, University of Liverpool
11/08/2017

Key Points:

-> Mapping is now complete - 76 mapping points in total. Size of exported and
   unzipped obj, mtl and dat files = 1.58GB

-> The loan Phab 2 Pro was used for a mapping run on Thursday 10th August. Everything
   went about as well as expected. If there is a lottery effect on mobile GPS sensors,
   the module in the loan device certainly wasn't any more or less accurate or precise.

-> Went over Jason's progress, the Blender python work is now done. Square/rectangular camera
   rigs can now be created around DAE models downloaded from Trimble warehouse, producing
   a varying numbers of RGB-D renderings depending on (user definable) dimensions of the rig.

-> We will stick with the SVM for machine learning for now, using the C++ implmentation
   of LIBSVM. LIBSVM is not natively parallelised. Please see:

   http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/faq.html#f432

   (and then search for "parallelize") for details on how to parallelise using OpenMP.
   A single threaded SVM will be implemented first whatever happens though. Time is
   running short.

   The SVM will be built around the ideas discussed in the paper
   "Covariance based point cloud descriptors for object detection and recognition"
   by Fehr et al. available via Science Direct.

-> Some thoughts on the future of the project were also discussed. Other data, e.g. the
   map of the campus that all students are given at the start of the year could be
   assimilated (or used to augment) OSM data. Original building plans/council planning
   permissions could also be used. The list is endless. This is even more of a computer
   vision/GIS task than the current project.

   Arup also operates an 80/20 policy like Google used to - so even if a KTP was put in
   place I could still continue to work on this project on my "20" day.

-> The dimensions of the RGB-D images (which will be 3*8xwxh for RGB and 8xw*h for D)
   was also discussed. All images rendered so far are 400x400 - w and h will be experimental
   parameters and will heavily affect the generation speed of covariance descriptors.

-> There was also another chat about publication, probably in a conference proceedings
   somewhere. This will be reviewed much later!

Next Tasks:

-> Crack on with the SVM, make something work before we start messing about with the
   parameters

Next meeting:

-> TDB
