	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the requirements for designing systems to support wayfinding for visually impaired individuals. We report the results of an interview study with 20 individuals with visual impairments, asking about their way-finding tools, techniques, and obstacles. Our findings provide an account of the practices followed when navigating familiar, unfamiliar, and dynamic environments, and common breakdowns encountered during the wayfinding process. The findings from this study suggest ways of implementing a location-based system to assist in the recovery from various obstacles.},
